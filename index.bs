Title: User Preference Media Features Client Hints Header

Abstract: HTTP Client Hints defines an `Accept-CH` response header that servers can use to advertise their use of request headers for proactive content negotiation. This spec introduces a new Critical Client Hint header called `User-Pref-Media-Features`, which notifies the server about user preferences that will meaningfully alter the requested resource, like, for example, the currently preferred color scheme.

Introduction {#intro}
=====================

CSS media queries, and specifically
[user preference media features](https://drafts.csswg.org/mediaqueries-5/#mf-user-preferences)
like `prefers-color-scheme` or `prefers-reduced-motion`, have a potentially
[significant impact](https://webkit.org/blog/8892/dark-mode-in-web-inspector/#:~:text=implementing%20dark%20mode%20took%20over%201%2C000%20lines%20of%20css.)
on the amount of CSS that needs to be delivered by a page.

High-traffic sites like search engines or news sites that
wish to honor user preference media features like `prefers-color-scheme` and
that inline CSS for performance reasons, need to know about the preferred color
scheme (or other user preference media features respectively) ideally at request
time, so that the initial HTML payload already has the right CSS inlined.

Additionally, and specifically for `prefers-color-scheme`, sites by all means
want to avoid a Flash of inAccurate coloR Theme
([FART](https://css-tricks.com/flash-of-inaccurate-color-theme-fart/)).

### Usage Example ### {#example}

1. The client makes an initial request to the server.
   <pre class="highlight">
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
   </pre>
1. The server responds, telling the client that it accepts the
   `User-Pref-Media-Features` and the `Sec-CH-Example` [[!CLIENT-HINTS]], out of
   which it considers `User-Pref-Media-Features` a Critical Client Hint that it
   also varies the response on.
   <pre class="highlight">
     HTTP/1.1 200 OK
     Content-Type: text/html
     Accept-CH: User-Pref-Media-Features, Sec-CH-Example
     Vary: User-Pref-Media-Features
     Critical-CH: User-Pref-Media-Features
   </pre>
1. The client then retries the request, telling the server that it has a user
   preference for dark-schemed content according to [[!MEDIA-QUERIES-LEVEL-5]].
   <pre class="highlight">
     GET / HTTP/1.1
     Host: example.com
     User-Pref-Media-Features: prefers-color-scheme="dark"
     Sec-CH-Example: 1
   </pre>
1. The server can then tailor the response to the client's preferences accordingly.

User Preference Media Features (Client Hint) Header Field {#sec-user-pref-meia-features-client-hint-header}
=====================

The User Preference Media header field is a [[CLIENT-HINTS]] header.
It is a [=structured header value=] containing a [=dictionary=] of name-value pairs where
the names are the names of the media features and where the values are [=items=] of type [=string=]
that consist of the valid values for each media feature as defined in [[!MEDIA-QUERIES-LEVEL-5]].
The ABNF (Augmented Backus-Naur Form) syntax for the `User-Pref-Media-Features` header field is as follows:

~~~ abnf
  User-Pref-Media-Features = dict-member *( OWS "," OWS dict-member )  
   dict-member             = member-name [ "=" member-value ]
   member-name             = key
   member-value            = sf-item
   sf-item                 = bare-item
   bare-item               = sf-string
~~~

Security Considerations {#sec-security-considerations}
=======================================
The User Preference Media Features Client Hint header will only be available to HTTPS secure contexts.  
The
[Security Considerations](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8942#section-4)
of HTTP Client Hints and the
[Security Considerations](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-davidben-http-client-hint-reliability-02#section-5)
of Client Hint Reliability likewise apply to this proposal.
